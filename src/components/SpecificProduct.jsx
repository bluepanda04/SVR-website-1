The system uses Infrared sensor to find the path and ultrasound sensor for obstacle detection which is controlled by C programmed microcontroller and the same drives the geared DC motor. The user will get thorough knowledge about functioning and interfacing of an IR sensor, a DC motor & an ultrasound sensor. This project will also help the user in developing programming logic using if-else function. This very simple and easy to build kit is perfect for beginners and is a great learning platform to get into robotics and engineering.",

    description: "Two wheeled self-balancing robot, which is based on an inverted pendulum system, is dynamically stable but statically unstable. The robot involves various physics and control theories. This project describes the modeling of the two wheeled self-balancing robot, designs the robot controller using PID and implements the controller on the robot. In this project, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used, which combines accelerometer and gyroscope measurement in order to estimate and obtain the tilt angle of the robot. The PID controller is applied to correct the error between the desired set point and the actual tilt angle and adjust the dc motor speed accordingly to balance the robot. The result obtained shows that the PID controller is able to balance the robot acceptably but with some limitations. The simulation result of the model is compared with the developed hardware and the performance of the controller is analyzed and discussed.",
